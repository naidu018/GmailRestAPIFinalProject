1) If title contains "Out of office", then user can delete without reason ----> (DONE!)

2) Add a tag to emails sent from us to know if an email is a reply from a previous mail, 
	in that case the user can delete without reason ----> (DONE!)

3) Change "Original message" style while in "Read" mode 
	(not grey background, because it doesn't look like the main email) ----> (DONE!)

4) While assigning a paper, set psetup on change, if only 1 psetup is selected. 
Keep menu open when assigning multiple papers only. ----> (DONE!)

5) Bug fix: when removing all psetups from the dropdown, 
I can't type anymore, just select by clicking  ----> (DONE!)

6) Display deadline options using buttons, not a dropdown menu, 
to make the selection more visible and immediately available   ----> (DONE!)

7) On deadline set, automatically assign it to myself  ----> (DONE!)

Add "Next shift" option on deadline selection (+8h)   ----> (DONE!)

Other deadline options should be:
Immediate [30m]
ASAP [1h]
When I have time [3h]

Use star symbol for assigned, not bold as current setting    ----> (DONE!)
Use bold for "Not read" emails   ----> (DONE!)
Move "Assigned time ago" on table to assigned user mouse over, instead of being always visible
(too much info is already being displayed on the table)    ----> (DONE!)

Add new "Priority" column on table
(@Emily: please provide icon and color for each priority type - I would like to use bootstrap's icons if possible!)    ----> (DONE!)

I think we might have to re-discuss the color system over. I had the feeling everyone was a bit confused. Current conventions are:
Not assigned:
Yellow after 10 minutes
Red after 20 minutes
Assigned
Yellow if less than 2 hours from deadline
Red when less than 1 hour is left         ----> (DONE!)
